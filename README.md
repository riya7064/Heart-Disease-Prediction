# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, accounting for over 17.9 million deaths per year. Early detection and prevention of heart disease can significantly reduce the risk of mortality and improve quality of life. However, identifying individuals at high risk of heart disease is a complex task, requiring careful analysis of various factors, including medical history, lifestyle, and physiological characteristics.
A machine learning model that can accurately predict the risk of heart disease based on a set of input features, including demographic, and medical factors.
The goal is to create a predictive model that can identify individuals at high risk of heart disease, enabling early intervention and prevention strategies to reduce the risk of heart disease.

The proposed system aims to address the challenge of predicting the risk of individuals with heart disease. This involves leveraging data analytics and machine learning techniques to forecast demand patterns accurately. The solution will consist of the following components:
Data Collection:
         A data set which consists of 
                   Demographic features: age, sex.
                   Medical features: blood pressure, cholesterol levels, blood sugar levels, etc.
Data Preprocessing: Clean the data and process it by finding the outliers. Outliers can be found easily by visual representation.
Machine Learning Algorithm: According to the outliers in the data, choose the accurate Machine Learning Algorithm to predict the risk of Heart disease based on the pattern of the data.
